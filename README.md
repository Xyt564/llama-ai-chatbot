# 🤖 Llama-3.1-8B Local CLI Chatbot

A fast, fully local CLI chatbot powered by **Meta Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct** using `llama-cpp-python`.

This project is optimized for low-to-mid range hardware and provides a smooth streaming chat experience directly in your terminal — no APIs, no cloud, fully offline.

## 🧪 Tested Hardware

**This project has ONLY been tested on the following system:**

- **CPU:** Intel i3-1215U  
- **RAM:** 8GB  
- **GPU:** Intel UHD Graphics  
- **OS:** Linux (Pop!_OS / Debian-based)

> ⚠️ Performance and memory usage may vary on other hardware.

## ❗ Important — Model Not Included

The AI model is **NOT included in this repository** because GitHub has file size limits.

You must download the model manually from Hugging Face.

---

## 📥 Required Model

Download the GGUF model from:

👉 https://huggingface.co/bartowski/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-GGUF

**Required file:**

```
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf
```

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Xyt564/llama-ai-chatbot.git
```

```bash
cd llama-ai-chatbot
```

---

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 3. Create the models directory

```bash
mkdir -p models
```

> Save ur Ai model inside the models folder

---

### 4. Download and place the model

Move the downloaded file to:

```
models/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf
```

⚠️ The program will fail to start if the model is not in this exact location.

---

### 5. Run the chatbot

```bash
python3 main.py
```

> On first launch, the model will load into memory — this may take a little time on lower-end CPUs.

---

## 💬 Available Commands

Inside the chatbot, you can use:

| Command        | Description                |
| -------------- | -------------------------- |
| `/help`        | Show help menu             |

## ⚙️ Performance Notes

This configuration is tuned specifically for **8GB RAM systems**: 

* Context length: **24k tokens**
* Quantization: **Q4_K_M**
* CPU threads: **7**
* KV cache: ~6.5GB
* Model size: ~4.5GB

> Ram usage can be lowered but it affect the performance heavily and make it extremly slow.

> Visit my phi-2 gui ai chatbot for lower ram systems.

If you experience:

* ❌ Out of memory
* ❌ Heavy swapping
* ❌ Slow responses

You may need to:

* reduce `n_ctx`
* reduce threads
* use a smaller quant

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

* Python **3.10+**
* Linux recommended
* ~7GB free RAM minimum
* GGUF model file

---

## 📌 Notes

* Runs CPU-only by default
* GPU acceleration can be enabled by adjusting `n_gpu_layers`
* Chat history is stored in `chat_history/`
* Streaming is enabled for better responsiveness

> Only change these if you know what ur doing
